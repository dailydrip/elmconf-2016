## Talks

### Code is the Easy Part - Evan Czaplicki

#### Random notable bits

##### Batching Work

RE: his projects' tendency to gather a ton of issues before any work is batched:

> At this point people are crying in the streets, they've been displaced by
> floods...locusts...

##### Collaboration

Talked about elm-format, elm-webgl, elm-css, elm-reactor and how people just
build things because they need them :)  Talked about just getting into the
elm-dev, introducing yourself, talking, getting feedback.  The point is: Code is
the easy part!

#### Elm Reactor

Showed off a pretty awesome implementation of elm-reactor / debug mode.  Really
exciting stuff - all history of `Msg`s, see the whole model with expandos.
