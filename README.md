### Code is the Easy Part - Evan Czaplicki

> Just do a good job. -- Guido van Rossum

#### Random notable bits

##### Batching Work

RE: his projects' tendency to gather a ton of issues before any work is batched:

> At this point people are crying in the streets, they've been displaced by
> floods...locusts...

##### Collaboration

Talked about elm-format, elm-webgl, elm-css, elm-reactor and how people just
build things because they need them :)  Talked about just getting into the
elm-dev, introducing yourself, talking, getting feedback.  The point is: Code is
the easy part!

#### Elm Reactor

Showed off a pretty awesome implementation of elm-reactor / debug mode.  Really
exciting stuff - all history of `Msg`s, see the whole model with expandos.

ZOMG export the `Msg` history, move to different browser, import it there!

#### What is next for Elm?

- Work on code swapping
- Server-side rendering
- Improve Packaging
- ???
  - Platforms?
    - Server
    - Mobile
    - WebAssembly
  - Tools?
    - Type Suggestions
    - REPL
  - Misc?
    - Single-Page Apps Documentation
    - HTTP in core
    - Timely Fixes

One of the points is, what's a way we can work on something that's not just an
improvement but maybe hasn't been done in programming languages before.

### Beyond Hello World and Todo Lists - Ossi Hanhinen

- Overview
- Lessons learned
  - Project structure
  - Refactoring
  - Message passing
  - Code reuse
- Protips (TM)
- War^H^H^HTrue Stories

#### True Story #1

> Generalization: wait for features to stabilize.  Did it too early, had to redo
> it multiple times - just be lazy and duplicate initially!

#### Words

- triplet
  - `(init, update, view)`
  - init returns `(Model, Cmd Msg)`
  - update -> `(Model, Cmd Msg)`
  - view - `Html Msg`
- helper function, returns whatever type
- "Routing" "pages" in SPA with URLs

#### Protip #1

elm-format rocks!

#### Projects

(codenames)

- Ferrari
  - Developed during 2015, thing he wrote "how elm made our work better" about.
  - Tool for newspaper editors to set how the news shows up on the site.  Choose
    articles and article blocks, drag and droppy thing to layout the news site.
  - Started with 0.15
  - probably up to 0.17 now?
  - SSO that only worked on the customer premises
- D25
  - Simple social media thing of sorts.
  - Using sporto/hop for routing and navigation, works really nicely for them.

#### True Story #2

> Everything is **not** a component.

#### Context-Pattern

Have a context you want to use for different modules.  Gives you a simple way to
communicate things down from ancestors in your hierarchy.

```elm
type alias Context =
    { hostname : String
    , user : User
    -- ...
    }
```

```elm
-- Page.elm
init : Context -> (Model, Cmd Msg)
```

#### True Story #3

> Real data can break your app.

In the Ferrari application, when first trying it out with real world data, the
app wouldn't start at all.  Errors in the console even though the code was
compiling perfectly.  Dumbfounded: "how can the data itself break our
application?"

Ultimately had something to do with integers.  Database IDs were more than what
a 32-bit integer can hold!  Circumvented the problem by using a Float type for
it.

#### Authentication

Externalize it if possible.

Your goals:

- anonymous use
- same app logged in/out?
- routes differe?

#### Protip #2

```elm
type RemoteData e a
    = NotAskes
    | Loading
    | Success a
    | Failure e
```

#### Login

```elm
type ToplevelRouter (Maybe Context) (Maybe AppRouter)
-- AppRouter is the routes for the logged in application
```

- When page is loaded, status check to the backend.
- Backend responds either with the logged in user data or 'no logged in user with this session id'.
- If the user exists, initialize the context (which has the user as a plain value).
- Then initialize the `AppRouter` with an actual context value.
  - `AppRouter` never has to deal with `Maybe` - always have a context, always
    have a user.

#### Protip extravaganza!

```elm
case Debug.log "sweet" pin of
    Luke ->
        -- ...
```

```elm
task
    |> Task.map (log "great success")
    |> Task.mapError (log "here's where it fails")
```

```elm
    thing
        |> squeeze
        |> log "squeezed"
        |> tweeze
        |> log "tweezed"
```

#### Project Structure

##### Ferrari

- elm 0.15, no StartApp
- initally had `Model/Article.elm`, `Update/Article.elm`, `View/Article.elm`.
  Eventually moved each model and update into the same file for each type, keep
  view dir.
- The initial move made it impossible to work because all the files were called
  `Article.elm` !!!

##### True Story #4

In the beginning of the project, they wrote unit tests for every function.
Found it wasn't that useful because the majority of functions were just
returning HTML and the unit tests were not terribly useful/helpful.  Toned down
a lot of what they unit tested, focused on the more difficult logical parts of
the code.  Found end-to-end testing was really what they wanted.

> Tests: ROI

##### d25

- elm 0.16, with StartApp
- Initially just put all the files in one folder.
  - Worked for quite a while, til around 20 modules or so it started to get
    harder to find what you were looking for.
- Later, broke up top level dirs:
  - Routers
  - Types
  - Pages
  - Helpers
  - Components

##### Protip #n

> Ports are your friends!

If you're on a schedule, think about...when you're facing a difficult problem in
Elm, and you know that it's easy to work around that using JavaScript, then just
go for it.

##### Personal Learnings

- Reuse
  - everything is not a component.
  - sometimes the tool that you need is maybe just to refactor the `let` block
    into separate functions, or refactor the nested `view` functions into more
    detailed helper functions that you can use from elsewhere.
  - functions are nice
  - state management is not nice
- ROI
  - "How am I going to make it work now?"
    - Very likely in an agile project that it's going to change anyway.
    - Makes sense to not go for the most elegant solution every time, esp. if
      it's going to take a lot of time.
- Structuring
  - Slap everything in the same directory and be done with it until it gets too
    much.  Then refactor to what that current project seems to need.
- Solve the problem **at hand**
  - This is the whole key thing he wanted to stress here.  "I don't want to
    componentize things anymore, I don't want to generalize beforehand.  I just
    want to solve the current problem."
  - That will make it possible for me to move on, and in retrospect I can see
    the whole thing much clearer.
